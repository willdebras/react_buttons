# react_buttons

This codesandbox is the completion of Josh Comeau's CSS for Javascript Developers workshop on buttons.

It features a `React.js` component that allows buttons of various styles and sizes that are created with `styled-components`.

The buttons were styled to match the following specification sheet created in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/rDeVdaes4jtX8V11Yt5aun/Button-Component?node-id=0%3A1
